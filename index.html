            <h2 class="chapter-title">Chapter 1: Life</h2>
            <p>My name is Zeyn Tsubasa. To most, I’m the man who built an empire. To others, I’m a name whispered in fear when the night grows too quiet. But no one remembers where I came from—not the child I was, nor the path that twisted me into the man I became.</p>
            <p>I wasn’t born a devil. The world made me one.</p>
            <p>I grew up in Setagaya, Tokyo, in a crumbling apartment where the walls were thin enough to hear every scream and sob from our neighbors. My father was a taxi driver who worked himself into an early grave. My mother? She left one morning and never came back. Just a crumpled note and the smell of cheap perfume lingering in the air. After that, it was just me and my sister, Hana. She was six. I was nine.</p>
            <p>I remember walking her home from school, stepping over broken beer bottles, dodging the gangs that prowled the alleys. But no matter how dark the world around us got, Hana always smiled. She had this way of making even the worst days feel bearable.</p>
            <p>“Someday,” she used to say, “we’ll have a house with a garden. You’ll have a desk by the window where you can write your stories. I’ll have a swing set under a cherry tree.”</p>
            <p>For a while, I believed her.</p>
            <p>But dreams don’t mean shit when you’re starving.</p>
            <p>The first time I stole something, I was ten. A loaf of bread. The store owner caught me and threw me into the street. “You little thief,” he spat. “Your kind always ends up the same—dead or in prison.”</p>
            <p>That night, Hana cried—not because we’d been caught, but because she hated seeing me hurt. “You don’t have to do that, Zeyn,” she whispered. “We’ll be okay.”</p>
            <p>But we weren’t.</p>
            <p>When she got sick, I realized how powerless I was. The coughing started small, then got worse. Medicine cost money we didn’t have. Doctors didn’t care about kids like us. I tried everything—begging, stealing, even asking the gangs for help. They only laughed.</p>
            <p>Hana died on a rainy Tuesday. She was eight years old.</p>
            <p>That was the day I stopped dreaming. That was the day I learned the only thing that mattered in this world was power.</p>
            <p>They say monsters are born. That’s a lie. Monsters are made.</p>

        <div class="chapter">
            <h2 class="chapter-title">Chapter 2: The Devil</h2>
            <p>I took Akio’s cut-up limbs to Daichi and placed them on his table. Daichi looked at me in a way that no one has ever looked at me before.</p>
            <p>He said while shivering, “Who is this?”</p>
            <p>I replied, “The remains of the person that killed Takehiro.”</p>
            <p>Daichi looked at me with fear in his eyes and said, “Takehiro is dead.”</p>
            <p>And I heard a noise behind me, “Get out. I wanna speak to Daichi.”</p>
            <p>I looked behind me; it was Yumi. I turned towards her and said, “Zeyn, don’t.” Daichi said.</p>
            <p>A memory of me and Takehiro came to mind. It was when I was about a year ago. Me and Takehiro were in a bar, and he said to me, “If you had the chance to change one thing, what would it be?”</p>
            <p>Hana’s death came to mind, but something inside of me said, “If you brought her back to life, she’d be a burden.”</p>
            <p>So I replied to Takehiro, “I would change nothing.”</p>
            <p>He said, “Bullshit.”</p>
            <p>I said, “What would you change?”</p>
            <p>He said, “The first time I ever killed.”</p>
            <p>I said with a serious face, “No, the killing part itself. I would change it to that I never killed.”</p>
            <p>He said, “No, the killing part itself. I would change it to that I never killed.”</p>
            <p>I said jokingly, “Bullshit, you enjoy killing.”</p>
            <p>He stood up and walked out of the bar.</p>
            <p>Later that night, he said, “Do you enjoy killing?”</p>
            <p>I said, “Yes, if I never killed, I would not be where I am today, and I only kill people that deserve it.”</p>
            <p>He said, “Do you?”</p>
            <p>I looked at him and said, “I think I do.”</p>
            <p>And he said, “Well, I hope for your own sake, you lose the enjoyment in killing.”</p>
            <p>And I heard the sound of his body dropping to the ground right after he said those words. Back to the present.</p>
            <p>“Zeyn, don’t,” Daichi said.</p>
            <p>“What did you say?” I replied to Yumi.</p>
            <p>She replied with a slightly less aggressive look, “Get out.”</p>
            <p>I said, “Ok” and I grabbed her by the neck and put her to the wall.</p>
            <p>“Listen very carefully, you spoiled brat. We all will die, but some of us sooner than others. And if you don’t want to die today, get out,” I said.</p>
            <p>She looked at me in the eyes, and for the slightest second, I saw Hana looking at me with fear in her eyes. “What have you become?” Hana said.</p>
            <p>As soon as she said that, I let go of Yumi and looked at Daichi and said, “I quit.”</p>
            <p>As I walked out, I saw Yumi looking at me the same way Daichi did when I put the limbs of Akio on his table—the fear.</p>
            <p>I went back to my apartment, and as soon as I walked in, I got a call from Daichi. I don’t remember why, but I picked up.</p>
            <p>“Zeyn, Ryuji is coming for you. Pack your things and go,” Daichi said, and he hung up.</p>
            <p>I took a chair and sat down for the first time with fear in my heart. All I could hear was the sound of Takehiro falling on the floor and Hana’s words over and over. I blacked out. When I woke up, I heard the sound of a knock on my door. And at that moment, I realized I had nothing left, so why not just end it there. I opened the door, and this tall bearded man with a huge scar on his eye and short black hair in a black suit was standing there.</p>
            <p>I looked him in the eyes, and all I saw was a void.</p>
            <p>Ryuji said, “Death will come for us all, but some sooner than others.”</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="chapter">
            <h2 class="chapter-title">Chapter 3: Destruction</h2>
            <p>I was only 9 when I first got to see how much people feared my father.</p>
            <p>Mrs. Yonjah says, “Welcome to your new class. Please present yourself to your classmates.”</p>
            <p>Yumi says, “My name is Yumi Satague. I am 9. I live in Tokyo. My father’s name is Ryuji Satague.”</p>
            <p>Mrs. Yonjah walks out of the class.</p>
            <p>Mrs. Yonjah says, “I quit.”</p>
            <p>Principal Dondji says, “You know if you leave, they will kill you.”</p>
            <p>Mrs. Yonjah says, “And if I make his daughter slightly angry, they’ll do the same.”</p>
            <p>Principal Dondji says, “It’s your funeral.”</p>
            <p>I was behind the door listening, and later that day, I told my father what happened. He looked at me and said, “Everything is okay.”</p>
            <p>Mrs. Yonjah went missing after that. They found her body 7 days later in a box outside of the school.</p>
            <p>When I was 17, I got to see what kind of monster my father was. It was a rainy day, and I was supposed to be asleep in my bed, but I couldn’t sleep, so I started to draw. And I heard a loud gunshot downstairs, so I went out of my room quietly to check it out. There I found my father had killed my uncle, and I kept watching out of curiosity what he’d do next. And I saw what I wish I had never seen. My father cut him and started eating his liver. Daichi, a long-time family ally, was standing right next to him, observing.</p>
            <p>So the very next morning, I decided to confront Daichi about it. He was like a father to me. How could he just watch that monster that I call dad eat his own brother’s liver? So I went to Daichi’s office. I had a pistol in my pocket just in case. I found Daichi in his office, and I said to him, “What kind of person are you?”</p>
            <p>He said, “What do you mean?”</p>
            <p>I replied, “My father’s a cannibal.”</p>
            <p>He looked at me with a confused look, but I could see the fear in his eyes.</p>
            <p>He said, “Are you okay? What did you see?”</p>
            <p>I took out the gun and shot him in the arm. As I was walking out, there were these two idiots looking at me, but one of them had this look in his eye. It was the same look that my father had when he was done eating the liver of my uncle. The way he looked at Daichi was the same look that idiot had on his face—the look of emptiness.</p>
            <p>A day later, when I came back from school, I saw my father and Daichi talking in the living room. And as soon as I came home, my father called for me, and as soon as I walked in, he had that look—emptiness. He said, “Honey, why did you shoot Daichi?”</p>
            <p>I didn’t answer. I walked out.</p>
            <p>The next day, I went back to Daichi to ask him why he didn’t tell my father.</p>
            <p>And the same idiot was there. I told him, “Get out. I wanna speak to Daichi.” And he turned slowly with this look. It was not the same look he had before. He had anger in his eyes—it was a look I never seen before.</p>
            <p>And I tried to contain my fear and I said one last time, “Get out.”</p>
            <p>And he grabbed me by the neck and he said, “Listen very carefully, you spoiled brat. We all will die, but some of us sooner than others. And if you don’t want to die today, get out.”</p>
            <p>And I don’t know what happened, but his face shifted from anger to empathy, and he just walked out.</p>
            <p>That day I felt fear that I never felt before.</p>

        <div class="chapter">
            <h2 class="chapter-title">Chapter 4: The Monster</h2>
            <p>After Ryuji said those words, he handed me a file and said, “Kill this man and you’ll be shown mercy.”</p>
            <p>And he left. I sat down again with one thing on my mind: “What the FUCK just happened.” And out of nowhere, Hana is in front of me and she says, “Don’t do it. RUN.”</p>
            <p>And she disappears. “I really need some sleep,” I said to myself.</p>
            <p>The next day I wake up, and the first thing I see is the file on the table. I remember leaving it in the kitchen. “How did it get there?”</p>
            <p>So after a few minutes, I decide to open it. There’s this image of Daichi, and on the image, it’s written in what I suppose is a red marker, “You Have Until Friday 12:00AM.”</p>
            <p>I say to myself, “Isn’t today Friday?”</p>
            <p>All of a sudden, I hear a loud banging noise and what I think to be a little girl’s voice saying, “Dad,” “DAD,” “Dad, PLEASE COME HOME.”</p>
            <p>I go to check it out, and I see this little girl, probably 7 or 8 years old, so I open the door and say, “Your father’s not here.”</p>
            <p>She looks at me with tears running down her cheeks. “Are you Zeyn?”</p>
            <p>I said, “Yes.”</p>
            <p>She says softly, “Where’s my dad?”</p>
            <p>I said, “Who’s your dad?”</p>
            <p>She says, “Takehiro.”</p>
            <p>And for the second time since Hana’s death, I feel what I can only describe as pain inside.</p>
            <p>And before I can answer, I see Ryuji sitting on a bench outside with this smirk on his face.</p>
            <p>And what I felt at that moment, the only word I could use for it is fear.</p>
            <p>I say to the girl, “Come inside. I’m making breakfast.” She looks at me and says, “Did you kill my father?”</p>
            <p>I said, “What, no.”</p>
            <p>She says, “Then tell me where he is.” And Ryuji stands up and says, “Your father’s dead.” And he walks away.</p>
            <p>As he said those words, I see the soul leaving that little girl.</p>
            <p>And I don’t know what happened. Something clicked inside of me. Empathy was gone. I closed the door, leaving the girl there, went, and grabbed my gun. And as I was opening the door, I see the girl leaving with Ryuji. So I run to grab her from him, and as I try to grab her hands, she looks at Ryuji the way a child would look at his father, and so I let her go with him. But as they were walking away, Ryuji said, “Tick, tick, tick. Time’s running out.”</p>
            <p>So I leave to go find Daichi. I go to his office, and as expected, he’s not there. But knowing Daichi, he’s not gonna run, so I go to Donka’s bar where Takehiro asked me that question, and the same place we were sitting, I find Daichi there with a gun in his hand and a bottle of beer on the table.</p>
            <p>I say, “Hello, Daichi.”</p>
            <p>He looks at me with a cold face and says, “If you’re still alive, that means my time’s run out.”</p>
            <p>And he takes his gun, puts it to his head, and before he pulls the trigger, he says, “Do you believe in heaven?”</p>
            <p>I reply, “No.”</p>
            <p>He says, “Well, even if it did, I won’t be going there.”</p>
            <p>He took his own life that day, but I knew one thing—Ryuji was gonna pay.</p>

        <div class="chapter">
            <h2 class="chapter-title">Chapter 5: All Alone</h2>
            <p>It’s been three weeks since I killed Daichi. I can’t say I felt bad, but since then, I realized one thing: it’s better to have nothing to lose than have something to lose.</p>
            <p>I moved to Shibuya, but I can’t say I’ve slept since I killed Daichi. The reason I don’t sleep is not because I killed Daichi. No, it’s because I haven’t killed. It’s becoming an urge, a poison inside of me. The feeling of the blood dripping when you stab someone is what I can only describe as relieving.</p>
            <p>“So tonight, I’m gonna kill. My neighbor. He’s a rapist. That makes it right to kill him,” I said.</p>
            <p>Hana says, “You’ve lasted three weeks. One more week, and you would’ve lasted a month.”</p>
            <p>Takehiro says, “The only person you get to kill is Ryuji.”</p>
            <p>Hana replies, “No killing.”</p>
            <p>Zeyn says, “Both of you shut up. You’re both dead. There’s nothing you can do to stop me.”</p>
            <p>*Knock, Knock*</p>
            <p>Mr. Sonjue says, “Hello, who’s that?”</p>
            <p>Zeyn says, “Your neighbor. I just wanna talk about that smell. Open the door.”</p>
            <p>*Opens door*</p>
            <p>Mr. Sonjue says, “What smell?”</p>
            <p>Zeyn says, “Don’t you smell that?”</p>
            <p>Mr. Sonjue says, “No.”</p>
            <p>Zeyn says, “The smell of death.”</p>
            <p>*Stabs in the heart*</p>
            <p>Hana says, “You shouldn’t have done that.”</p>
            <p>Takehiro says, “I think this is one of those moments you want to change.”</p>
            <p>Zeyn says in satisfaction, “The relief.”</p>
            <p>Zeyn says, “Now Ryuji’s next.”</p>
            <p>*Back in Setagaya*</p>
            <p>Yumi says, “How much?”</p>
            <p>Gongu says, “Your father is a hard man to kill.”</p>
            <p>Yumi says, “I said how much?”</p>
            <p>Gongu says, “10 billion yen.”</p>
            <p>Yumi says, “Tell your brother he’s crazy.”</p>
            <p>Gongu says, “You’re crazy.”</p>
            <p>Gongi says, “Fine, 100 million yen.”</p>
            <p>Yumi says, “Deal.”</p>
            <p>*Back to Shibuya*</p>
            <p>Hana says, “Are you actually going back to Setagaya?”</p>
            <p>Zeyn says, “Yes, for the millionth time.”</p>
            <p>Takehiro says, “I think he’s going crazy.”</p>
            <p>Hana says, “You only think that now. You never realized he’s talking to two dead people.”</p>
            <p>Zeyn says, “Both of you shut up.”</p>
            <p>Takehiro says, “So you basically just said shut up to yourself.”</p>
            <p>Zeyn says, “I’m done talking.”</p>
            <p>*Knock, Knock, Knock*</p>
            <p>Hana says, “Who’s that?”</p>
            <p>*File slips under door*</p>
            <p>Takehiro says, “Not again.”</p>
            <p>*Zeyn takes file and opens it*</p>
            <p>*Zeyn reads*</p>
            <p>Hana says, “Mom.”</p>
            <p>Zeyn says, “She’s no mother. She abandoned us when we needed her most. Why should I let her help me now?”</p>
            <p>*Silence*</p>
            <p>Zeyn says, “Finally, the voices are gone. It’s time to kill her.”</p>
            <p>*Back in Setagaya*</p>
            <p>Yumi says, “It’s been a month. Is he dead?”</p>
            <p>Gongu says while sobbing, “They killed my brother, Gongi.”</p>
            <p>*Hands Gongu a suitcase*</p>
            <p>Yumi says, “Thank you for your help. Now get out.”</p>
            <p>Gongu says, “I don’t want your money. You know the apple doesn’t fall far from the tree.”</p>
            <p>*Yumi shoots Gongu*</p>
            <p>Yumi says, “You’re wrong. I’m not like that monster.”</p>
            <p>*Back to Shibuya*</p>
            <p>Mr. Blob says, “Did he receive it?”</p>
            <p>Donku says, “Yes, sir.”</p>

            <p>*Sits in a bar drinking beer*</p>
            <p>Zeyn says, “One more please.”</p>
            <p>*Mr. Blob comes and sits next to him*</p>
            <p>Mr. Blob says, “Hello. I work for your mother, Mrs. Shun.”</p>
            <p>Zeyn says, “Do you know what’s the difference between a psychopath and a sociopath?”</p>
            <p>Mr. Blob says, “One’s created by society, and the other is born a killer.”</p>
            <p>Zeyn says, “Nobody’s born a killer. The world makes us what we are. One last question before we go.”</p>
            <p>Mr. Blob says, “What?”</p>
            <p>Zeyn says, “Do you have children?”</p>
            <p>Mr. Blob says, “No, why?”</p>
            <p>*Zeyn pulls out a gun and shoots him. People scream and run*</p>

            <p>Zeyn (exhales, gripping his gun): “This is it.”</p>
            <p>Takehiro (cracking his knuckles, grinning): “We’re back, baby!”</p>
            <p>Hana (cold, focused): “Time to end this.”</p>
            <p>Somewhere else… A dimly lit room, rain tapping against the window.</p>
            <p>Yumi (narrowing her eyes): “Who the hell are you?”</p>
            <p>Agent-1 (calm, precise): “We work for your father. He wants to see you.”</p>
            <p>Yumi (shaking her head, stepping back): “I’m not going anywhere.”</p>
            <p>Agent-2 (scoffing): “That wasn’t a request.”</p>
            <p>Before Yumi can react, a fist collides with her jaw. Everything fades to black.</p>
            <p>Later that night… Outside Dratoji Tower, neon signs humming in the rain.</p>
            <p>Zeyn (staring up at the towering building, jaw clenched): “This is it. Dratoji Tower. Ryuji’s in there.”</p>
            <p>Guard-1 (firm, stepping forward): “Sir, you need to leave the premises.”</p>
            <p>Zeyn doesn’t hesitate—his gun is up, a single shot echoes. The guard drops.</p>
            <p>Hana (watching the body fall, voice low): “I tried to make you better.”</p>
            <p>Zeyn (cold, unreadable): “There is no better me.”</p>
            <p>Inside Dratoji Tower… A dimly lit office, tension thick in the air.</p>
            <p>Ryuji (smirking as he sips his drink): “Hello, Yumi.”</p>
            <p>Yumi (glaring, wrists bound to the chair): “Hello, Father.”</p>
            <p>Ryuji (leaning forward): “How long has it been?”</p>
            <p>Yumi (voice sharp): “Untie me.”</p>
            <p>Ryuji (amused): “I asked you a question.”</p>
            <p>Yumi (defiant): “And I won’t answer until I’m free.”</p>
            <p>Silence. Then, Ryuji exhales, swirling his drink.</p>
            <p>Ryuji (to his men, casually): “Send her to Ajioto Mental Hospital.”</p>
            <p>Yumi (eyes widening): “What?”</p>
            <p>Ryuji (smirking, leaning back): “And cut off her tongue.”</p>
            <p>Agent-1 (whispering into his earpiece): “Sir… he’s here.”</p>
            <p>Ryuji (gaze darkening): “And?”</p>
            <p>Agent-1 (hesitant): “He’s… talking to himself.”</p>
            <p>Ryuji (low, sharp): “No one talks. No one looks at him. Even if he starts shooting.”</p>
            <p>Floor 1… The silence is eerie, too perfect.</p>
            <p>Takehiro (frowning, gripping his gun): “Why the hell haven’t they shot at us?”</p>
            <p>Hana (quiet, eyes scanning the hall): “Ryuji knows you’re coming.”</p>
            <p>Zeyn exhales, rolling his shoulders. The storm is coming.</p>
            <p>Floor 5… Ryuji watches the monitors, fingers tapping against the desk.</p>
            <p>Ryuji (calm, controlled): “What floor?”</p>
            <p>Agent-1 (checking the feed): “Third.”</p>
            <p>Ryuji (nods): “Tell the guards to bring him to me.”</p>
            <p>Floor 3… Shadows stretch long under flickering lights.</p>
            <p>Takehiro (side-eyeing Zeyn): “So what’s the plan? They already know we’re here.”</p>
            <p>A guard steps forward, lowering his weapon slightly.</p>
            <p>Guard-2 (calm, steady): “Come with me.”</p>
            <p>Zeyn doesn0t break stride. The gun raises. A single shot. The guard crumples.</p>
            <p>Hana (disappointed, shaking her head): “I tried to help you.”</p>
            <p>Zeyn (reloading, voice low): “Not the time or place.”</p>
            <p>Another guard approaches, hands up.</p>
            <p>Guard-3 (careful): “Follow me, sir.”</p>
            <p>Zeyn (slipping his gun into his coat): “Okay.”</p>
            <p>Floor 5… Ryuji waits, the air thick with anticipation.</p>
            <p>Ryuji (smirking, arms open): “Hello, Zeyn.”</p>
            <p>Zeyn (stepping forward, expression unreadable): “Hello, Ryuji.”</p>
            <p>The gun is out in a flash.</p>
            <p>Ryuji (amused, tilting his head): “Go on. Shoot me.”</p>
            <p>Zeyn (soft, almost whispering): “We all die… but some of us sooner than others.”</p>
            <p>A heartbeat. Then—</p>
            <p>BANG.</p>
            <p>Ryuji slumps back, lifeless.</p>
            <p>Zeyn (exhaling, stepping back): “He’s dead.”</p>
            <p>The room shifts. Every guard in the room raises their weapons, safeties clicking off.</p>
            <p>Zeyn (smirking, whispering to himself): “Death is here.”</p>
            <p>Cut to outside the building. Gunfire erupts. Smoke fills the night sky.</p>
            <p>Monsters are not born. Monsters are created.</p>
            <p>The End.</p>
